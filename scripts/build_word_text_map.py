"""Precompute global_word_idx -> real Uthmani word text.

The shipped corpus (ordered_quran_phonemes.json) segments each ayah into
phoneme-words for ASR matching, but that segmentation doesn't line up 1:1
with written words -- Tajweed liaison rules merge some adjacent written
words into one phoneme unit (e.g. "مِن قَبْلِكَ" -> one unit), and
muqatta'at letters split one written word into several (e.g. "الٓمٓ" ->
two). So there's no direct way to say "phoneme-word #3 is written word
#3".

This resolves it in two steps, both done here (once, offline) rather than
live:
1. Exact: quran-transcript's own phonetizer (github.com/obadx/quran-transcript,
   already installed -- it's literally the tool that produced the
   corpus's training labels per the model card) exposes a per-input-char
   position mapping (`mappings`) from its phonetization output. Used to
   derive, precisely, which output phoneme span corresponds to each
   written word -- not by naively splitting on spaces (liaison can fuse
   two written words' output together with no space at all).
2. Fuzzy: quran-transcript's phoneme rendering doesn't exactly match this
   corpus's own (different muqatta'at handling, minor spelling/madd
   convention differences even with matched moshaf settings) -- verified
   by direct testing, not assumed. So step 1's per-written-word phoneme
   groups are aligned against the corpus's aya_phonemes_list via a
   word-level edit-distance DP (rapidfuzz-scored), not a strict
   positional match. Mismatches here are typically small and localized
   (an occasional adjacent-word merge), not wholesale restructuring --
   also verified empirically before committing to this approach.

3. Split: for a corpus phoneme-word that covers *multiple* written words
   (the merge case), align/word_split.split_merged_unit does a further
   character-level DP between the corpus word's own phoneme string and
   the concatenation of its qt phoneme groups, to find the real split
   points inside it -- so each written word gets its own phoneme
   sub-span in the corpus's native convention (what the ASR was trained
   on), not just a merged text label. Confidence-gated (MIN_SPLIT_
   CONFIDENCE); below threshold, the unit is kept as one indivisible
   entry rather than guessing wrong boundaries -- see REPORT_PATH.

Output: models/word_text_map.json, a list indexed by (original corpus)
global_word_idx. Each entry is either null (couldn't be confidently
mapped -- logged, not guessed at) or
{"words": [{"text": ..., "phoneme_text": ..., "isolated_phoneme_text": ...}, ...], "continues_previous": bool}.
"isolated_phoneme_text" is that word's own phonetic rendering computed on
its own (see isolated_phonemes()) -- used by align/word_aligner.py to
recover cross-word tajweed-liaison bleed and pause-dropped endings without
needing any context from neighboring words.
"words" has one entry per real written word this corpus unit resolves to
(more than one only when the split in step 3 succeeded; otherwise a
single entry whose "text" may still be multiple space-joined written
words, same as before that step existed). "continues_previous" is true
when this corpus phoneme-word is part of the *same* real written word as
the immediately preceding global_word_idx (a muqatta'at split, e.g.
"الٓمٓ" spans two phoneme-word units both carrying continues_previous
split across them) -- consumers must treat a continues_previous run as
one logical word, not report each unit as if it were a separate word.

models/word_text_map_overrides.json (optional, hand-maintained -- never
generated) can supply manual fixes for ayahs the automated split
couldn't resolve confidently: same per-entry shape as the main output,
keyed by global_word_idx as a JSON string. Applied on top of the
automated result on every run, so it survives regeneration.

    Each corpus word is matched against a *run* of one or more consecutive
    qt words (substitution cost = 1 - similarity of the corpus word
    against the run's concatenation), and the DP picks whichever run
    length best explains that corpus word's actual phoneme content. This
    is deliberately not "match 1 qt word, then glue any leftover qt words
    onto whichever corpus word happens to follow": that forward-only
    gluing is directionally biased and got the *wrong* written word
    attached when a merge's extra phonetic content bleeds backward into
    the *previous* corpus word instead (found via 2:12: "لَّا"'s phonemes
    are actually a suffix of "وَلَـٰكِن"'s corpus unit, but forward-gluing
    attached "لَّا" to the next corpus unit, "يَشْعُرُونَ", where its
    phonemes don't appear at all). Letting the run itself carry the
    match means the alignment is chosen by which grouping actually fits
    the content, not by which side of a word it happened to be glued to.

    split, one written word spanning several corpus units) still costs a
    flat 1.0 and is filled from a neighbor below. A qt word matching no
